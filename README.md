Unsupervised Machine Learning

Clustering:

- Grouping unlabelled datapoints into groups or clusters representing similar data is called clustering.
- Clustering is highly used in data analysis, customer segmentation, recommender systems, search engines, image segmentation, semi-supervised learning, dimensionality reduction, etc.
- Some of the examples of Clustering usages are

    1. Anomaly Detection:
        - Also called Outlier Detection.
        - Abnormal instances in the data are called Anomalies, and normal instances are called Inliers. 
        - Anomaly detection is used in fraud detection such as detecting defective items in manufacturing, detecting new trends in time series, or removing outliers in a dataset before training the data with a new model.
        
    2. Density Estimation:
        - Commonly used for anamoly detection for instances located in very low-density regions.
        - Used in data analysis and visualization.
        - Used to estimate Probability Density Function (PDF) for the random process that generated the dataset.

Clustering Algorithms:

1. K-Means:
   - K-means is a data clustering approach for unsupervised machine learning that can separate unlabeled data into a predetermined number of disjoint groups of equal variance – clusters – based on their similarities.
    - The amount of clusters created is determined by the value of k – a hyperparameter that’s chosen before running the algorithm.
 2. DBSCAN:
     - Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.
     - DBSCAN algorithm defines clusters as continuous regions of high density.
